# FieldAdminister
This is a very simple mod that allows a colonist to administer downed pawns drugs from their inventory so they can carry on fighting or walk themselves to the hospital.

Requires a mod that allows items to be picked up to a pawns inventory such as pickup and haul, combat extended, smart medicine, RPGstyle inventory or whatever you can think of.

Best used with a mod that also allows stabilising so the pawn doesn't die on the way to get help...

Compatible with medicines+ (done in a very clumsy hard-coded way)

# Credits
Modified a fair bit of the code from combat extended/field medic's stabilising feature
